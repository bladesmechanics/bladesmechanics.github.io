[Resistance Rolls](https://bladesinthedark.com/resistance-armor) can cost up to 5 stress.

Beyond one dice, the distribution skews increasingly towards having a large chance of low stress cost while having a small chance of a high stress cost. We can greatly improve the readability by calculating the average stress cost but this will not fully protray the shape of the distribution. Players may be more focused on unlucky outcomes not average ones so along with the average we can also calculate an average for the bottom (unluckiest) 10% of outcomes. The 0%-10% chance of stress range shown above corresponds to the the bottom 10% figures shown below.

The bottom 10% figure is the same for zero and one dice but that does not mean that those are equal. One dice is still signficantly better. In fact moving from zero to one or from one to two dice both reduce the stress cost by about one whole stress point on average! Even looking at the bottom 10%, pushing yourself will likely result in more stress than it would have otherwise. However, getting an assist may be worth it as it could effectively move (on average) one stress to a different player, but we start seeing diminishing returns beyond two dice.
