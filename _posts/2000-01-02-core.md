# *Core (Action) dice mechanics*

First we look at the [core dice system](https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system):

Each additional D6, beyond the first, halves the chance of failure. Zero Dice is a special case that doesn't quite follow the exponential pattern. Players are 25% less likely to fail going from zero to one dice, and 25% less likely to fail again going from one dice to two. Beyond two dice we see significant but diminishing returns.

Bonus: Here's an extra big version for large group actions!
