First, we look at the [core dice system](https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system):

![Stacked Bar Chart](/img/DiceChances2.png "Core Dice Outcomes")

Each additional six-sided dice, beyond the first, halves the chance of failure. Zero dice is a special case that doesn't quite follow the exponential pattern. Players are 25% less likely to fail going from zero to one dice, and 25% less likely to fail again going from one dice to two. Beyond two dice we see significant but diminishing returns.

## *Group Actions*

Here's an extra big version of the chart above for group rolls!

The downside of group actions is the cost in stress. But how much stress will a group action cost on average?

## *Calculate Average Stress from Group Rolls*

<div align="center" style="width: auto">

<table class='custom-table'>
	<thead>

		<th style="text-align:right">Dice</th>
		<th>Stress</th>

	<tbody>

		<td style="text-align:right">Player has 0d</td>

Sum the stress for all participating players *including the leader*. If there are two players and a total of two dice a group action should cost an average of one stress: the same as getting assistance.
