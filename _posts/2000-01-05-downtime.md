### *Heat and Progress Clocks*

There's a bunch of different rolls that can be taken as [downtime activities](https://bladesinthedark.com/downtime-activities). It turns out that both [heat](https://bladesinthedark.com/heat) reduction and project clocks use the same mechanics. [Project clocks](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks) could be for long term projects, healing, etc.

During downtime players can spend one coin to increase the level of a result. However, players can also spend one coin to get an additional downtime activity. Assuming that another attempt is possible it appears to almost always be better to roll again rather than spending coin to increase the result. For example on a heat reduction roll, rolling again is guaranteed to at least reduce one heat but has the potential to do more, whereas increasing the result would only reduce one more heat except when going from a six to a critical. However, criticals can usuall only happen when there are at least two dice and the average heat reduction with two dice is slightly higher than two. Thus the only case where increasing the result is worth it on average would be to get an otherwise impossible critical with zero or one dice after rolling a six naturally.

Since two dice will reduce about two heat on average and it's very common to have at least two dice, then one coin (spent on a downtime activity) is worth an average of at least two heat.

### *Stress Reduction*

![Stress Relief Bar Chart](/img/AverageStressRelief.png "Stress Relief")

Each dice gives about one more stress point back until after two dice when diminishing returns start kicking in. It's unlikely that the rules intend for pushing yourself to be allowed on stress relief rolls but it's also not worth it anyway.

Zero dice makes over indulgence harder but that advantage is almost completely eaten up by the less efficient reduction in stress and ends up being (subjectively) not worth it.

The efficiency of spending a coin to increase the result depends on the situation. Increasing a five to a six is inefficient. Increasing a one to a four or five is much more valuable.

If the player can opt to take the heat for overindulgence (rather than other consequences for overindulgence), and since we established above that two heat are worth about one coin then overindulgence costs about one coin as well.
